# Time series classification

Natural systems tend to be highly *non-stationary* but such changes are often overlooked and poorly described by linear regressions. The aim of *this tool* is to offer a simple method to *characterize the trajectory of ecological time series*. The method is particularly suited to detect *abrupt changes*.

Single time series can be classified using this [*R Shiny app*](https://matpelissie.shinyapps.io/trajshift_app/).

An R package will be soon available.

More details about the classification method are available in [Pélissié _et al._ 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110429)
